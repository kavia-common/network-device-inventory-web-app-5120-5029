# Vite environment variables for ReactFrontend

# PUBLIC_INTERFACE
# Base URL for the Flask backend API. Defaults to localhost:3001 if not set.
# Example for preview environments where backend is exposed on same host but different port:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
# If not set, the app will default to http://localhost:3001 in code.
# You can override during build or in runtime environment of the preview.
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# PUBLIC_INTERFACE
# Port for Vite dev server/preview. The vite.config.ts reads this to bind on port 3000.
